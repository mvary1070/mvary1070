## Hi there 👋

<!--
**mvary1070/mvary1070** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I’m Miraya, a software engineer based in Germany.

I mostly work on frontend stuff — React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and a bit of animation with Framer Motion.

I also use Figma for UI design and Procreate when I want to sketch ideas.

This is a fresh profile where I’ll be uploading some smaller projects, experiments, and things I’m currently working on. Everything here is built from scratch, no copy/paste templates.

Tools & Tech

React, TypeScript, Tailwind

Framer Motion for animations

Figma, Apple Notes, Procreate

A Bit About Me

🐈‍⬛ I have two cats

🍵 Not a coffee or tea person

🍥 Into anime — Demon Slayer is a favorite

🧱 I like building things that are simple, useful, and easy to understand
